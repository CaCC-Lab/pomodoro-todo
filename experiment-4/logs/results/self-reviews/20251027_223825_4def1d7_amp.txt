      "body": "This commit introduces a complete application (1529 lines across 3 files) without any README.md or user documentation. Stakeholders, new developers, and end users have no way to understand what this application does, how to use it, or how to deploy it. At minimum, a README should include: project description, features list, installation/setup steps, usage instructions, browser compatibility requirements, and license information. The file references localStorage, Web Audio API, and Notification API which have specific browser requirements that must be documented.",

Stakeholders reviewing project history cannot understand the scope or purpose of this change. Commit messages should describe *what* was built (Pomodoro timer + Todo app with localStorage persistence, statistics tracking, etc.) and *why* it was built.

The CONFIG object (app.js:8-17) and error handling (app.js:24-33) suggest production readiness, but stakeholders cannot assess deployment risk or user reach without compatibility documentation. For example, Web Audio API requires user interaction in some browsers, and Notification API requires HTTPS in production.",

Users must discover features like double-click to edit, keyboard shortcuts (Enter/Escape in editing mode), or the long break cycle logic through trial and error.

While the vanilla JS approach avoids build complexity, the lack of any package.json means no npm scripts for common tasks, no dependency tracking for future enhancements, and no version information.
