      "body": "The new sanitizer now escapes `&`, `<`, `>` and quotes, but we call it before persisting user input (`const title = sanitize(...)`) and again when rendering via `textContent`. This double pass causes legitimate characters to be corrupted, e.g. entering `Chris's plan` is stored as `Chris&#x27;s plan`, and then re-sanitized to `Chris&amp;#x27;s plan`, which is exactly what users see in the UI and in prompts. The regression affects any title containing `&`, quotes, or angle brackets and persists across reloads, so it is a high-severity data-integrity bug that needs to be fixed before release.",
