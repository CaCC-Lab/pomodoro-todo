## Analysis

### üî¥ Critical Issues

I‚Äôm reviewing the code and found a critical bug where changing timer settings resets the remaining time even if the timer is paused or running, causing progress loss. Another severe issue is the use of UTC dates for ‚Äútoday‚Äù keys, which misaligns day-based stats for users in positive timezones. These both deserve high priority mentions with file references.
I‚Äôm highlighting two high-severity issues: first, the timer progress resets when saving settings during a pause, caused by `handleSettingsSubmit` at line 857 resetting remaining time unconditionally, and similarly in `resetSettingsToDefault`; second, `getTodayKey` at line 1008 uses `toISOString` which applies UTC rather than local time, causing date misalignments for users in JST timezones. I‚Äôll explain each with repro steps, suggest possible fixes like checking `isPaused` before resetting and using local date logic, and note assumptions about the intended behavior. No other major problems immediately stand out.
