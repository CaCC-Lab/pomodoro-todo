# Droid Enterprise Standards-Focused Code Review Report

**Commit**: `b2afeaa` (`HEAD`)
**Date**: 2025-10-27 22:41:23
**Timeout**: 900s
**Review Type**: Enterprise Standards & Production Readiness

## Overview

- **Overall Correctness**: patch is incorrect
- **Confidence Score**: 0.6
- **Explanation**: Importing a running session leaves the app locked because the timer is marked running without being restarted, and the weekly insights chart never renders any data even when history exists. These regressions break advertised functionality, so the patch is not ready.

## Enterprise Findings


### 🟠 P1 - Urgent (Next Cycle)

#### [P1] Resume timer after importing running session

**File**: `/home/ryu/projects/comparison-pomodoro-todo/experiment-2-independent-plans/6-droid-independent/output/app.js` (Lines 1038-1042)
**Confidence**: 0.6

`mergeImportedData` copies the imported timer (`state.timer = normalizeTimer({ ...state.timer, ...data.timer });`) and immediately emits `timer:updated`, so `state.timer.isRunning` stays `true` while no interval is started. Repro: start a pomodoro with focus mode enabled, export the data, reload, then import it—the focus overlay remains active, the timer display freezes, and the UI is unusable because `applyFocusState()` sees `isRunning === true` but the session never resumes. Please either call `resumeFromPersisted()` (or equivalent) when `isRunning` is true, or reset the imported timer to a stopped state.

#### [P1] Populate weekly chart when history exists

**File**: `/home/ryu/projects/comparison-pomodoro-todo/experiment-2-independent-plans/6-droid-independent/output/app.js` (Lines 814-822)
**Confidence**: 0.5

`renderWeeklyChart()` clears the container and only renders the placeholder when `hasData` is false. When `state.today.pomodoros` or `state.history` has entries (`hasData === true`), the function exits without appending anything, so after recording pomodoros the “過去7日間のポモドーロ” panel stays empty. We should render the chart bars when data is present instead of returning an empty container.
