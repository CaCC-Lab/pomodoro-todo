      "body": "The `renderTasks` function uses `innerHTML` to render task items from user input. The `task.title` property, which is controlled by the user, is directly concatenated into the HTML string without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code. For example, a task title like `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` would execute a script when the task list is rendered. This could be used to steal other tasks from `localStorage` or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user.\n\nTo fix this, avoid using `innerHTML`. Instead, create DOM elements programmatically (e.g., using `document.createElement`) and set their content using `textContent`, which is inherently safe against XSS.",
