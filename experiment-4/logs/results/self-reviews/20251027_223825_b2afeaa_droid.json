Repro: start a pomodoro with focus mode enabled, export the data, reload, then import it—the focus overlay remains active, the timer display freezes, and the UI is unusable because `applyFocusState()` sees `isRunning === true` but the session never resumes. Please either call `resumeFromPersisted()` (or equivalent) when `isRunning` is true, or reset the imported timer to a stopped state.",
