      "title": "[P2] Insufficient XSS protection in sanitize() function",
      "body": "The `sanitize()` function uses basic HTML entity encoding but doesn't handle all XSS vectors. Specifically, it doesn't protect against event handler attributes (e.g., `onclick=\"alert(1)\"`), `javascript:` URLs, or SVG-based XSS. While the HTML tag removal helps, an attacker could potentially inject malicious content through task titles that gets rendered. Consider using a well-tested library like DOMPurify for comprehensive XSS protection, or at minimum, validate input length and character whitelist more strictly.",

If an XSS vulnerability exists elsewhere on the same origin, an attacker could read all user data including task contents, work patterns, and usage history. While localStorage is appropriate for non-sensitive data, consider warning users not to store confidential information in task titles, or implement client-side encryption for sensitive fields using Web Crypto API.",

A malicious user or script could rapidly create thousands of tasks to exhaust localStorage quota (typically 5-10MB), causing storage errors and application failure for the user. Implement a maximum task count limit (e.g., 1000 tasks) and consider rate limiting task creation to prevent abuse.",

While not a direct security vulnerability, this could be perceived as intrusive and may train users to accept permission requests without consideration. Best practice is to explain why notifications are needed before requesting permission, and only request when the user explicitly opts in via a settings UI.",

  "overall_correctness": "patch is correct",
  "overall_explanation": "The implementation demonstrates good security awareness with input sanitization, proper use of strict mode, and Content Security Policy-friendly code (no eval, inline handlers). The sanitize() function shows security consciousness, though it could be stronger. No critical security vulnerabilities that would prevent deployment were found. The main concerns are around XSS protection depth and localStorage exposure, which are common in client-side applications and acceptable for a task management app handling non-confidential data. The code is production-ready with recommended improvements.",
