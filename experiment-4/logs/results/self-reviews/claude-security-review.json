      "body": "The `sanitize()` function uses basic HTML entity encoding but doesn't handle all XSS vectors. Specifically, it doesn't protect against event handler attributes (e.g., `onclick=\"alert(1)\"`), `javascript:` URLs, or SVG-based XSS. While the HTML tag removal helps, an attacker could potentially inject malicious content through task titles that gets rendered. Consider using a well-tested library like DOMPurify for comprehensive XSS protection, or at minimum, validate input length and character whitelist more strictly.",
