PomoTodo Droid Solo Implementation Log
-------------------------------------
Phase 0  [Setup]      : output directory created, architecture aligned with MVC-lite plan.
Phase 1  [Design]     : HTML/CSS/JS structure defined, accessibility and storage strategy confirmed.
Phase 2  [Build]      : Implemented UI shell, styling system, and vanilla JS controller/state logic.
Phase 3  [Optimization]: Consolidated code to meet <700 total lines and ensured storage/timer accuracy.
Phase 4  [QA]         : Manual reasoning pass over timer transitions, task lifecycle, and persistence paths.
Phase 5  [Metrics]    : Captured line counts and qualitative quality scores in metrics.json.

Notable Notes:
- Timer drift mitigated via system clock based countdown.
- LocalStorage guarded with availability checks and error messaging.
- Notification, confirm dialog, and keyboard shortcuts implemented per plan.
